			<h2 style="text-align: center;">Name Entry Event Commands by MarkyJoe1990</h2>
			<h1>What is this?</h1>
			<p>It's a custom event command that opens up a window and prompts the player to put in a new name for the specified unit.</p>
			<h1>How do I use it?</h1>
			<p>Refer to <a href="$commandreference.html">$commandreference.html</a> for instructions on using the even command.</p>
			<h1>Who do I thank for this?</h1>
			<p>Aside from me, you can thank CardCaph (Discord: CardCaph#0588) for some of the lovely key button graphics!</p>
			<h1>What are the controls?</h1>
			<p>Assuming you are using the default keyboard settings for SRPG Studio: Z selects a key. X back spaces unless the string is empty, in which it cancels the name entry if that's enabled. A and S both toggle upper and lower case. C adds a space unless the keyboard doesn't have a space key. Lastly, the space key confirms the name entry.</p>
			<h1>Are they any settings I can mess with?</h1>
			<p>There is a file called "name-entry-settings.js" located inside the "Name-Entry-Event-Command" folder. You can set the font color, which is in hexidecimal. You can also set which set of key graphics are used. KEYS_GRAPHICS_INDEX tells the plugin what row of graphics to use in the keys material folder. You can add more options by simply editing the image.</p>
			<h1>How do I contact you?</h1>
			<p>Preferably by me e-mail at markyjoe1990@gmail.com</p>
