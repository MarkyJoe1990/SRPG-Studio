			<h2 align="center">Selector Event Commands by MarkyJoe1990</h2>
			<h2>How to use</h2>
			<p>1. Put the entire "Selector-Event-Commands" folder in your SRPG Studio plugin folder.</p>
			<p>2. Click Database -> Config -> Variables -> Options and check the box that allows variables to be used in events</p>
			<p>3. Click Tools -> Options -> Data and check the box that says "Display id next to data name"</p>
			<p>4. In your events, create an "Execute Script" event command.</p>
			<p>5. In the "Script" tab, click "Call Event Command" and put in the name of the event you want to call.</p>
			<p>6. In the "Property" field, create open and closed curly braces "{}", and put whatever arguments specified by each event command in between the braces. Example:</p>
			<pre>{
	var1: "TargetItem",
	weaponList: [0,1,2,3],
	itemList: [0,1,2,3],
	selfSwitch: "A"
}</pre>
			<p>5. If you are using an event command that uses Original Data, go to that tab and set whatever fields that are being used.</p>

			<h2>Properties</h2>
			<h3>var1 : "Variable Name"</h3>
			<p>String. When the player makes a selection, the selection's ID is stored in the variable whose name you specify here. This property is required for all selector events. <b>Using an ID variable is recommended</b></p>
			<h3>var2 : "Variable Name"</h3>
			<p>String. When the player makes a selection, the selection's position on the list is stored in the variable whose name you specify here. This property is optional for all selector events and currently does not do anything useful.</p>
			<h3>selfSwitch: "Letter"</h3>
