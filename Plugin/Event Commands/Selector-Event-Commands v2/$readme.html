            <h2>What does this do?</h2>
            <p>This event command will display a window with a list inside, and prompt the player to select an option from the list. This list - depending on the type - can contain items/weapons, skills, states, units, classes and original data.</p>
            <p>Once the player has made a selection, the object's ID will be stored into your chosen variable, which can then be referenced in other event commands.</p>
            <p>If you're not sure what practical use this has then allow me to give you an example.</p>
            <p>Suppose you want an event that gives the main character a skill of the player's choosing. You can use this event to display a window with the skills you want the player to choose from. The chosen skill will be stored as a variable that you can then use in the "Increase Skill" event command to give them the skill they chose.</p>
            <h2>Why not just use the "Show Choices" event command instead?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>This select event command displays descriptions and info windows for most objects (the ones that don't can have those added to them by a programmer). This allows the player to make more informed decisions.</li>
                <li>The select event command's UI visualization is better looking and consistent with other UI elements such as when you're selecting a weapon to attack an enemy with.</li>
                <li>The "Show Choices" event command is very static, and doesn't allow you to select from more dynamic lists such as the items in a unit's inventory, or their current skills.</li>
                <li>You can submit javascript functions as an argument for your list, allowing you maximum flexibility in what the list contains.</li>
                <li>It's easier to work with, since "Show Choices" requires you to write events for every single option, whereas the select event command simply returns a variable for you to use.</li>
                <li>Adding everything you want in the list is easy, since it can use the Original Data Tab's "Multiple Data" field. Simply set the dataList property to <span>SEC.getListFromOriginalContent()</span>, then check the box of everything you want in the list.</li>
                <li>You can randomize what options are available in the list, and even give the player the option to reroll if they don't like their choices.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For any advanced user of SRPG Studio who loves event commands like "Extract Map Pos", this is the perfect sibling event command for you!</p>
            <h2>How to use</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Put the "Selector-Event-Commands-REVAMP" folder in your SRPG Studio plugin folder.</li>
                <li>Open up your project.</li>
                <li>Click Database -> Config -> Variables -> Options and check the box that allows Id variables to be used in events.</li>
                <li>Create an event and add an "Script Execute" event command.</li>
                <li>Set the type to "Call Event Command".</li>
                <li>Set the object name to "Select".</li>
                <li>In the property field, create an open and closed curly brace and enter the event's properties (see "Properties" section below). Here's an example.<br /><pre>{
    var1: "Target Item",
    dataList: SEC.getListFromOriginalContent(true, 6),
    dataType: "skill",
    maxCount: 3
}</pre></li>
                <li>The select event command should run successfully when your event runs.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Properties</h2>
            <h3>var1 : "Variable Name"</h3>
			<p>String. Required. When the player makes a selection, the selection's ID is stored in the variable whose name you specify here. <b>You will almost always want this to be an ID variable instead of a regular variable.</b></p>
            <h3>var2 : "Variable Name"</h3>
            <p>String. Optional. When the player makes a selection, the selection's position in the list is stored in the variable whose name you specify here.</p>
            <h3>dataList : DataList</h2>
            <p>DataList OR Function. USUALLY required. This is the list the player will be able to choose from. See "How To Get Data Lists" below. The default value depends on context.</p>
            <h3>dataType : "Name of Type"</h2>
            <p>String. Required. Specifies the type of data the list is meant to show. By default, the accepted strings are:
                <ul>
                    <li>"unit"</li>
                    <li>"class"</li>
                    <li>"item" or "weapon" (either will give the same result)</li>
                    <li>"skill"</li>
                    <li>"state"</li>
                    <li>"originaldata0" (for the first table of the original data table)</li>
                    <li>"originaldata1" (for the second table of the original data table)</li>
                    <li>"originaldata2" (for the third table of the original data table)</li>
                    <li>"originaldata3" (for the fourth table of the original data table)</li>
                    <li>"originaldata4" (for the fifth table of the original data table)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>selfSwitch : "Letter" or Number</h2>
            <p>Letter OR Number. Optional. If you want the player to be able to cancel out of the selection, you will need to set this.</p>
            <h3>maxCount : Number</h2>
            <p>Number. Optional. Useful only when you want the player to reroll their available options (See "Rerolling" section). The number of options available to the player are determined by this property. It also determines the number of times they can reroll, which is the size of your data divided by <span>maxCount</span>. Default is your data list's size.</p>
            <h3>rerollCallback : function() { your code here }</h2>
            <p>Function. Optional. This simply determines what to do after the player does a reroll. For example, if you need to track the number of times the player has rerolled in their run, you can do that here.</p>
            <h2>How To Get Data Lists</h2>
            <p>Data Lists are exactly what their name implies; a list of data of some kind. Using one of these as an argument however is not so simple, and thankfully is not always necessary.</p>
            <p>Depending on the data type you want the player to choose from, the default data list will vary:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>"unit".</b> Will default to the currently deployed player units. Otherwise you MUST specify a data list.</li>
                <li><b>"item" or "weapon".</b> Will default to the currently acting unit's inventory. Otherwise it will get the inventory of whatever unit you specify in the "Original Data" tab.</li>
                <li><b>"state".</b> Will default to the currently acting unit's status effects. Otherwise it will get the status effects of whatever unit you specify in the "Original Data" tab.</li>
                <li><b>"skill".</b> Will default to the currently acting unit's skill list. Otherwise it will get the skills of whatever unit you specify in the "Original Data" tab.</li>
                <li><b>"class" and all originaldata.</b> Nothing. You MUST specify a data list.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, let's say none of these are the list you want to use. You have a few options.</p>
            <p>You can set the dataList with <span>SelectEventControl.getListFromOriginalContent()</span>. This will generate a data list using everything you checkboxed in Original Data Tab -> Multiple Data. Bear in mind that you cannot mix and match, say, items and units together. The list needs to have objects of the same type, with the only exception being that you can mix items and weapons together.</p>
            <p>What's great about this function is that you can also specify if the list should be randomized, and what you want the final list size to be. So say that you want to generate a list of 10 items from a pool of 30 possible items. You'd write <span>SEC.getListFromOriginalContent(true, 10)</span> and then select 30 items in the Original Data tab.</p>
            <p>You can also use <span>SelectEventControl.getListFromIdArray()</span> if you would prefer to instead provide an array of IDs. Randomization is allowed here as well, but you will need to first provide the array and the dataType. Example: <span>SEC.getListFromIdArray([0, 1, 2], "item" true, 10)</span></p>
            <p>This is important to note, but similar to the previous function, you can mix items and weapons together. However, if you have items in your list, you will need to add 0x10000 to their ID. Otherwise, the game will think you're providing a weapon ID. Example: SEC.getListFromIdArray([0, 1, 2 + 0x10000], "item" true, 10) will provide two weapons and an item.</p>
            <p>I highly recommend looking at <span>Selector-Event-Control.js</span> to see how many easy options are already provided for you.</p>
            <p>If you are a little more savvy with programming in SRPG Studio, you don't have to limit yourself to the functions I provided. Any function will work so long as its return value is a Data List.</p>
            <h2>Rerolling</h2>
            <p>If the <span>maxCount</span> property is less than the data list's size, you will be given the option to reroll in-game. <span>maxCount</span> grabs a specific number of options from the data list and displays them as options to the player. When you reroll, those options are discarded and another batch of options are pulled from the data list. When the data list runs out of options, you can no longer reroll.</p>
            <p>If you want additional code to run after the player rerolls - such as using a global variable to track the number of times they rerolled - you can use <span>rerollCallback</span>.</p>
