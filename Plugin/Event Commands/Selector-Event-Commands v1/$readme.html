			<h1>What are these?</h1>
			<p>In this folder are 8 custom event commands usable in SRPG Studio. Each prompt the player to select from a list of either items, skills, units, classes or states. The resulting selection is stored as an ID variable that can be used for other event commands.</p>
			<h1>What's the practical use? Could you give me an example?</h1>
			<p>Let's say you wanted an NPC villager on the map whom - when talked to - would offer the player a choice between one of his inventory items. With the "Unit Item Selector" event command, you can have a menu pop up that shows every item in the villager's inventory, and let the player choose which item they want. Then you could use the "Increase Item" event to give that item to the player using whatever ID variable the Unit Item Selector command modified.</p>
			<p>Let's say you wanted a unit with the ability to copy the skills of enemies. You could create a Unit Event Command called "Mimic", select a target using "Extract Map Pos", select which skill to copy from the enemy using "Unit Skill Selector", then add the skill to the Mimic user using "Increase Skill" and the ID variable provided by "Unit Skill Selector"</p>
			<p>Let's say you wanted to make a staff that can inflict one of two status effects. You would make the staff a switch item, have an auto event check for the switch, select the enemy target using "Extract Map Pos", select what state to inflict on them using "State List Selector", then use the ID variable and "Inflict State" to inflict the chosen status.</p>
			<p>Screw it, let's throw the kitchen sink at them! Let's say you wanted to make a tower defense map where each turn, you spawn a unit whose location, class, inventory, and skills are all selected by you.</p>
			<p>That is now possible with the help of these event commands.</p>
			<h1>Holy crap, that sounds amazing! How do I use them!?</h1>
			<p>Refer to <a href="./$commandreference.html">$commandreference.html</a> for instructions on using the event commands</p>
			<h1>Who can I thank for this wonderous technology?</h1>
			<p>Aside from me, you can thank <b>Goinza</b> since I looked at his Combat Arts plugin a lot to figure out how to make the window appear and have you select something.</p>
			<h1>How do I contact you?</h1>
