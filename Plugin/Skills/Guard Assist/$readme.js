    Guard Assist (Remake)
    v1.0 by MarkyJoe1990, original concept by 仁菜 ()
    Original Plugin: https://ninasakureil.fanbox.cc/posts/3149661

    This is a remake of a plugin made by a Japanese Scripter.

    Units bearing this skill will move in front of allies
    being targetted by enemies and get attacked in their place
    so long as they have more than half of their max HP remaining.

    All you need to do to make the skill work is to create
    a custom skill with the keyword "Guard".

    The keyword can be changed in 00_config.js
